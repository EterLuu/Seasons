<h1>Seasons v2</h1> 
[Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Harieo/Seasons.svg?branch=master)

<p>Seasons is a little quirky plugin I made a few years ago to simulate real-life seasons in Minecraft, adding some
customised effects and weathers to add a new experience to playing survival</p>

<p>You can download the latest release of the plugin via SpigotMC by <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/seasons.39298/">Clicking Here</a>!

<h2>Modules Summary</h2>

<p>Seasons implements a <i>modular Maven</i> design which allows multiple versions of Spigot to be run with only 1 plugin</p>
<p>The modules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Core - Foundation of the plugin which detemines the version, holds the initial JavaPlugin class and runs Maven Shade</li>
  <li>Plugin - The core functionality of Seasons which is <b>not</b> version-specific</li>
  <li>v1_12_2_R1 - Implements functionality for Spigot versions 1.9-1.12</li>
  <li>v1_13_R1 - Implements functionality for Spigot versions 1.13-1.14</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are compiling the plugin locally, compile the root module (Seasons-parent) and use the shaded jar generated in the 
  core module (Seasons-Core) as that is a compilation of all other modules.</p>
